      Soulmates Thom and Chance make a connection during their senior year of high school, but two weeks before graduation, Thom suffers an unimaginable loss when Chance dies in a car accident. Chance’s death does more than ruin Thom’s life—it breaks his spirit. Devastated, he runs away.

      After years of drifting in and out of meaningless flings, Thom returns to his failing hometown during the holiday season, a wealthy man hell-bent on tearing everything down. As his old school collapses before him, satisfaction courses through his veins, but it’s short-lived when he catches the eye of a handsome stranger in the dilapidated neighborhood bar.

      There’s something familiar about the man’s looks, corn-fed humor, and charming personality that Thom can’t put his finger on. What should have been an anonymous hook-up turns unbelievable when the stranger claims to be his long-dead soulmate. 

      To complicate matters further, the more Thom digs, the more improbable his life becomes. The hot encounters, a secret legacy, and a family dinner with relatives he’d disowned all conspire to give him a second Chance at love, but will a mixed-up kid and crazy church-lady wreck Thom’s new lease on life?

      Frigid air kicked up the settling dust and drained away the sun’s meager heat. For the briefest instant, Thom swore he saw a figure stumbling aimlessly through the shifting cloud. With one blink, the figure disappeared.

      This Chance’s laugh sounded so real, so close to the moments Thom remembered that he nearly split in two. As it was, it cracked him enough that what he protected so dearly inside began leaking out

      For a moment, it was once again a chilly Friday night at a high school football game, where he and Chance sat high on the bleachers, huddled around Styrofoam cups filled with hot, boiled peanuts.

      Chance’s empathetic overtures were baffling, almost like a foreign language, as though he actually bought into the soft practice of talking through his feelings.
