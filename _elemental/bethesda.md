      From the outside looking in, John leads a boring life by day as a professor at a small liberal arts school in San Francisco. His nights are saucy, sinful even, when he services clients as a sex worker. He’s damned good at it, too, for reasons far surpassing simple technique, whether he’s entertaining super-hunky coeds or fulfilling the fantasies of married men on the down-low.

      Because John has a secret.

      It’s not that he’s thirty-five and feeling washed-up or that he’s got a crush on one of his clients.

      His secret could be he’s buried his rural, Southern roots, or that Paul, his first lover and preacher from back home, still preoccupies his thoughts. Maybe it’s the terrors he faced in conversion therapy as a teenager…but it’s none of those things.

      John’s secret is the Fountain, a mysterious well of energy within him he cannot control.

      Paul knows about the Fountain. So do John’s parents. Despite their best efforts to protect their dogma, it will all come out now that Paul has called John home to Georgia. To Bethesda.

      From the beginning, Paul had a unique hold on John. It wasn’t just the sex or even that Paul was his first. He was the only one besides John and his mother who knew all about the Fountain.

      'What you do here with these men is elemental—an unchangeable part of who you are. You can try to ignore it, but it will not be controlled.'

      In the end, everyone—preacher or john—responded to the Fountain in the same way. All of them, water in motion.

      He could keep the Fountain satisfied by healing his clients during sex and thumb his nose at the Family and its Father at the same time.
